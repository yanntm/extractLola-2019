# ExtractLola-2019

Extracted distribution of [Lola tool](http://service-technology.org/lola/) by Karsten Wolf and Torsten Liebke based on their distribution for the [MCC'2019](http://mcc.lip6.fr) competition.

This project automatically extracts and produces an archive containing the elements necessary to execute Lola to check MCC format inputs on a Linux x64 box.

The files are distributed here : [Generated Page](https://yanntm.github.io/ExtractLola-2019) as 

* a single archive [oracle.tgz](https://yanntm.github.io/ExtractLola-2019/lola-mcc-2019.tar.gz) containing all the elements that should be put in /home/mcc/BenchKit folder of a VM candidate for the MCC.
 
The intent is to use these files for integration within a chained workflow, or simply to ease installation of Lola in MCC mode for comparisons and tests.
